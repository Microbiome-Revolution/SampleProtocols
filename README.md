## 1. Team Visit Protocol

#### Rationale:
The goal of this experiment is to assess Gt abundance in soils, and its co-occurrence with other taxa. We will attempt to quantify this in fields that vary in their:
- climate and soil type
- managemnent (fertiliser, pesticide inputs)
- crop rotation [this year, and for the past several years]
- take-all disease severity [this year and for the past several years]

For our survey, the unit of replication is an individual field. There may be multiple fields sampled at a given farm, if the fields vary in management, rotation and/or disease severity. We wish to sample Gt DNA from topsoils, between 0-10cm, AND to culture Gt from wheat roots.

#### The following equipment and supplies are used:
- GPS
- Plastic bags + sharpie
- Soil auger with 5cm diameter to collect one sample of approximately 200g when deployed to 10cm depth
- Spade
- Ethanol (70%) in spray bottle + paper towels
- Cooler with ice packs
- Secateurs

#### Protocol:
For our site visits, we must record all the information that we are also soliciting from farmers through the mail-in sampling campain (*see protocol below*). This must be checked with the site or land manager.

1. We will be following the recommendation of Basu et al. (1977) for assessing severity of crop diseases with a clustered spacial distribution. They recommend a W-walk, encompassing the entire field, with samples taken at 10 regularly spaced intervals.

2. Use the GPS to mark out the four corners of the field, and from here calculate the parameters of the W-walk, i.e. the location of the 10 sampling points. 
   
   **Note:** Tom proposes an "X" design, where we sample 10 points along the red line (this is what the farmer is doing), but do we sample 10 or 9 (as the centre is repeated) points along the green line? Subsample of points along the red line are homogenised in the line.

3. Navigate to the first sampling point. Use the soil auger to take a sample to 10cm depth. Place in a Ziploc bag labelled with the name of field and sample point - e.g. **Cherry Farm - Field A - Point 1**

4. Use the spade to dig up a single wheat plant - the goal is to obtain the majority of the root system for that individual plant, and the associated rhizosphere soil. Use secateurs to clip the aboveground biomass, keeping a necessary ~5 cm of leaf tissue.

5. Repeat steps 3) and 4) for the remaining sampling point. Sterilise auger and spade between samples by wipe until visibly clean, spraying with ethanol, and wipe again.

6. Store samples in cooler on ice for transport back to laboratory. The protocol above should yield 2 kg of soil per field

## 2. Farmer Sampling Protocol
#### Rationale:
Ideally, we would ask farmers to replicate the Team Sampling Protocol, however this is too time intensive and complex to be realistic. Therefore, a minimum viable product that a farmer could deliver has been identified to provide a fair representation of the Gt status of a field - the unit of replication in this study. Lin et al. (1979) find that a simple diagonal sampling method, with 10 samples evenly spaced along the diagonal, is an acceptable sampling method for clustered disease distributions with incidence rates <20% or >80%.

The issue here is that fields vary in their size and walking a full diagonal might be time-consuming. Also, how should we direct the farmer to evenly space the sampling points when the diagonal would vary in size? 
- Assuming a typical lower bound for field size is 4ha, the diagonal of such a field would measure about 565m. 
- Again, assuming that 500m = 650 paces for the typical adult, we could approximate the diagonal sampling design by having the farmer take a sample every 65 paces along a straight line, probabl a tramline to provide easy access, until 10 samples are collected.

If we reduced the sampling interval to 10 paces, we'd obtain a much lower coverage of the whole field, with a diagonal of ~80m, but it may be worth reducing for farmer effort. This is the approach adopted below.

#### The following equipment and supplies are used:
Provided in the kit:
1. Plastic bags for plant storage (pre-labelled)
2. Soil container (pre-labelled) - *the right size should be determined to make sure it can accommodate the requested sampling design
3. 10cm ruler

Provided by the farmer:
1. Spade (small size, used for gardening)
2. Secateurs

#### Protocol:
The kit will have a QR code for farmers to answer specific questions about their field. 
1. Each sampling kit corresponds to one field. You may access the field from any point, but we recommend starting at the beginning of a transline, to make it easier to walk a distance of ~100m into the field

2. Use the gardening space to scoop a small amount of soil into the container. Make sure you are sampling soils in the crop and not in the tramline. Try to ensure you are diggin into the soil to a depth of approximately 10cm.

3. Walk 10 paces and repeat step 2.

4. Repeat until you have collected 10 'scoops' in total and walked 100 paces. All the soil should be put into the same container.

5. At the last sampling point, dig up a single wheat plant and put into the provided plastic bag. **Important:** We are mostly interested in the roots and the soil that sticks to the roots, so you can cut off the top of the plant to make it fit - don't try to remove soils from around the roots!

## 3. Soil Sample Processing Protocol
**To be covered**:
- How to homogenise + split sample among - 80 storage, 4C storage, air-dry storage (for biogeochemistry) [*If we wanted to use a sieve to homogenise we'd need to air dry the samples to be homogenised.]
- Culturing Gt from the plant root samples farmers send
- Sample labelling scheme

#### The following equipment and supplies are used:
- Plastic bags
- Weigh boat
- Scoopula/spoon

#### Sample labelling for a typical ziplock for kit samples:
- Farm name - kit sample - kit number [**Note:** @Paida says "I think we can get away with just the kit number as that will be tied to all the farm info]
- Full date - lab - initials
- Storage type: -80, AD, CR

#### Protocol for samples from sites we visit:
We will be collecting 10 samples per field, each about 200g totalling 2000g of soil per field. Our goal is to subsample and homogenise for later analyses. Protocol to be carried out within 48 hours of samples arriving (keep in cold room until processed).

1. Wipe area with ethanol and ensure it is clean. Get first sample for processing.

2. Put roughly 20g into one small plastic bag for -80 storage (~4 spoon scoops)

3. Put 30g in large plastic bag for air drying. Roll plastic bag at edges until about halfway so there is easier access for air drying.

4. Put 30g in another plastic bag for cold storage.
5. Leave the remaining soil in original bag. This will be homogenised with the other samples later.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until all samples have been subsampled, cleaning with ethanol between each sample. 
7. Pour all the remaining soil samples in their original bags into one plastic bag.
8. If soils are fairly sandy/crumbly place in plastic bag, seal and shake vigorously. If samples are clay-like and cannot be shaken, knead areas of soil to ‘melt’ the samples together. Sometimes you may need to use both techniques.
9. This homogenised sample should then be re-processed following Steps 2-4 above. 

    **Note:** All soil that remains from the homogenised sample (after removing ~50g for air-drying and freezer storage) should be placed in cold storage. So the 'biggest' sample, by volume, will be the cold-storage, homogenised sample.
10. You should end up with 33 samples from each field site (10 individual samples, and 1 homogenized sample x 3 storage conditions: -80, air-dried, cold storage) 

#### Protocol for processing wheat plants (which should arrive with a 'root ball' of soil):
1. Remove the wheat plant from the bag. Over sieve receiver, gently shake the root system to remove excess soil. 
2. Carefully, using a sterile brush or your fingers, brush the soil associated with the roots into the seive receiver. Then transfer all the soil in the pan to a clean plastic bag. This forms a rhizosphere soil sample, place this in the fridge for now. 
3. Gently rinse and examine roots for signature black lesions of take all disease. Store in ethanol after examination is completed - be sure to label 'FIELD SAMPLE' to distinguish from baited samples. We will retain this sample at Imperial.
4. Use the soil recovered in Step 2 for the protocol 'Seedling BioAssay - To recover Gt isolates from soil,' in the file called "Root or Soil Isolation of Gt_Rothamsted Protocol_Nov2023." 
5. Follow the protocol '003 Transportation of Gt isolates_Rothamsted_March 2024' to return any infected roots to our collaborators at Rothamsted within one week!!!


#### Protocol for processing soils that farmers return to us:
Farmers will be sending samples of approx. 1000 grams. These are samples taken from 10 points stored in one container. We will also be receiving one wheat plant root system. The goal is to ensure homogenisation and subsample these samples.
1. Clean the area with ethanol.
2. The sample the farmer sent is already in a container, shake this vigorously or use the pestle to knead the soil throughout the container to ensure homogenisation
3. Take 200g and place in a freezer bag for -80 storage
4. Take 300g and place in a new plastic bag for air drying
5. Leave the rest in the container and place in the cold room.
6. Follow the same wheat plant protocol for the wheat plants the farmers send
